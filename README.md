Hi I'm Julia, and I'm an intermediate Python coder. 
This is my code for a rock paper scissors game between a human and the computer. You can find the code in the next file. 
This code was inspired and partially mentored by Kylie Ying from her YouTube channel. You can find her Github profile at @kying18 and her YouTube at Kylie Ying.
In this project, a computer randomly chooses between rock, paper, and scissors. Next, the human player chooses one of the three options. The computer runs the algorithm to compare the two choices and show which player won. A note to all players: you don't have to type in "rock", "paper", or "scissors". You may simply use "r", "p" or "s" to abbreviate the options.
In this project, I used the Random module to help my computer randomly decide a move.
